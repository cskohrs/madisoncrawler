Wisconsin Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor has officially entered the 2026 state Supreme Court race, launching a campaign that promises to be one of the most consequential and closely watched judicial elections in recent Wisconsin history, with control of the court's liberal majority hanging in the balance.

"Wisconsin Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor has announced her candidacy for the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the 2026 election," AP News confirmed, marking the beginning of what political observers expect to be an intense, high-spending campaign that will likely draw national attention and outside money from across the political spectrum.

Taylor brings a distinctive background to the race that sets her apart from typical judicial candidates. As a former Democratic legislator and Planned Parenthood attorney, she is "known for supporting abortion rights, gun control, and unions," according to reporting, positioning her as an unabashedly progressive candidate in a state where judicial elections have become increasingly partisan and ideologically charged.

Her legislative experience provides both advantages and potential vulnerabilities. During her time in the Assembly, Taylor championed progressive causes including reproductive rights, environmental protection, and workers' rights, building a strong network of Democratic activists and donors. However, her partisan political background may also provide ammunition for conservative opponents who argue that judges should be nonpartisan and independent of political influence.

The timing of Taylor's announcement is strategically significant, coming as the court prepares to rule on Wisconsin's controversial 1849 abortion ban. The decision, expected in the coming months, will determine whether the pre-Civil War statute remains enforceable or whether modern reproductive rights take precedence. Taylor's strong pro-choice record will likely make abortion rights a central theme of her campaign, particularly if the court upholds the ban before the election.

The current ideological composition of the court adds urgency to the 2026 race. Liberals currently hold a narrow 4-3 majority, gained after Susan Crawford's decisive 2024 victory over conservative challenger Waukesha County Judge Jennifer Dorow. This majority has already begun reshaping Wisconsin law, with the redistricting decision being just the first of several major rulings expected to favor progressive positions.

However, this liberal majority remains fragile. The 2026 election will determine whether progressives can maintain their control or if conservatives can regain their influence on the court. The stakes couldn't be higher, as the winner will likely influence decisions on abortion rights, voting access, environmental regulations, labor law, and criminal justice for years to come.

The financial implications of this race are staggering. Recent Wisconsin Supreme Court elections have shattered spending records, with the 2023 race exceeding $50 million in total expenditures. The 2026 election, with control of the court at stake, could easily surpass that figure, drawing money from national political organizations, advocacy groups, and wealthy donors on both sides.

Campaign strategy will likely focus on key issues that resonate with Wisconsin voters. Beyond abortion rights, candidates will probably debate criminal justice reform, voting rights, environmental protection, and the proper role of courts in democratic governance. Taylor's background as both a legislator and judge provides her with a unique perspective on these issues, but also opens her to criticism about judicial independence.

As the campaign unfolds over the next year, Wisconsin voters will face a clear choice between two fundamentally different visions of the law and the role of courts in society. Taylor's candidacy ensures that this choice will be sharply defined, setting the stage for one of the most consequential judicial elections in Wisconsin history.
